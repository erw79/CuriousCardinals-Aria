## Division Practice
## Fill in what you think the output of the following operations will be

# Float Division
print(7 / 2)   
print("My Guess: ")

print(10 / 4)  
print("My Guess: ")

print(10 / 2)  
print("My Guess: ")


# Integer Division
print(7 // 2)  
print("My Guess: ")

print(10 // 4)
print("My Guess: ")

print(10 // 2)  
print("My Guess: ")

# Modulus
print(7 / 2)   
print("My Guess: ")

print(10 % 2)  
print("My Guess: ")



## Write a program that prints the numbers 1-50
## But...
#  If the number is divisible by 3 print "Fizz" instead
# If the number is divisible by 5 print "Buzz" instead
# If the number is divisible by both 5 and 3 print "FizzBuzz"
# If neither just print the number. 
# Utilize loops, if statements etc. !!
