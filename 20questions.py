# Print an introductory message
print("Hello! Welcome to 20 questions. Think of an animal and we will guess the animal in less than 20 questions!")

# Make a list of possibile answers and place 3 animals inside. Store this in a variable named possible_answers



# Ask the user for an input to a random first question and store it into a variable (like last week)
# Put this input statement into a For Loop
# You should loop through each question and place it into an input statement
# You will have to replace the random question we made up in the step above for this part.
